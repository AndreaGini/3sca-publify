Instruction

The Vagrant files are using Virtualbox as provider

The  configuration is for 3 servers:

db01 --> Mysql Server
pb01 --> Publify server
ha01 --> HAProxy server

The db01 need to be started first since is providing the DB for pb01

ha01 can be started at any time

vagrant up db01 && vagrant up pb01 && vagrant up ha01

after the complete installation access the frontend from:

http://localhost:3000 --> Publify served by HAProxy
http://localhost:8080 --> HAProxy statistics page

There is a puppet module for rubygem https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ruby , but I had a limited time to work on this and I didn't use this module, so the pupped manifest is not fancy and optimized .

Next release will have the puppetlabs-ruby module instead of the exec in the manifest and be more clean.
